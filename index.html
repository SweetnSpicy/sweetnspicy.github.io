        I'm hosting a game night for some fellow Joebros (plus ones allowed) 
        next *date straw poll below*.
        It is summer time and it's really hot so I've not hosted in a long time. Outside feels
        like death. Just been pool bumming it now that I've got one. Still can't do a breaststroke,
        that ish make no sense physically. There's some 'triphasic motion' bs or whatever. Anywho, all
        my aquatic skills went into deception as I wear the Secret Hitler Crown. Triple Platinum in 
        these Fascist streets! This how we looked celebrating on them libbys

        Address is 945 Sixth St. SW. 5-10min walk from the L'Enfant Plaza or Waterfront metro stations. 
        Green and Yellow line accessible.
        Not putting my apartment number because safety. I ain't gonna dox meself. 
        No map this time cuz lazy but it's a like a high rise complex thing. 
        Text me for the actual apartment number when you show up. For drivers, there's really convenient
        parking for 15 bucks in my garage. But thats 15 bucks :o . Should be street parking all around the
        building though.

        There will be snacks I guess maybe. Board/card games. Mario Kart. 
        Probs Smash and Mario Party. 
        Shirley temples. Alcohol? Camaraderie. 
        And if you don't come, I will be deeply offended and hate you forever.
