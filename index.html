        Address is 100 Florida Ave NE. 5m from TJ's. Not putting my apartment number because of safety reasons.
        I ain't gonna dox meself. Here's a map that I drew in PS in 3 mins while watching
        Daenarys Stormborn burn The Undying dude. Text me for the actual apartment number
        when/if you show up. Parking will be an issue so like... uhhhh. Can park near the CVS
        on First or in that weird Union Market-y area or on Eckington. But like also next to 
        Noma-Gallaudet stop on Red Line.
