        I'm hosting a game night for some fellow Joebros (plus ones allowed) 
        next *date straw poll below*.
        The main reason being I’m tryna play Secret Hitler (fun game. Questionable title) 
        with like 7+ ppl. And Mario Kart cuz I haven't played the 12 new maps. 
        But also it’s my final week in my sweet, very overpriced pad. 
        Rip in peace 5 min commute to work.

        Address is 100 Florida Ave NE. 5m walk from TJ's. Not putting my apartment number because of 
        safety reasons. I ain't gonna dox meself. Here's a map that I drew in PS in 3 mins. 
        Text me for the actual apartment number when you show up. Parking will be an 
        issue so like... don't drive? But also, you can just park in the TJ's parking lot 
        until 9pm. No one would notice, nor even care.

        got too lazy to get fancy with this e-vite card. Wanted to draw something too
        but jeez louise is that effort. It was gonna be Appa from ATLA with a TJ's outfit
        but nah. So here's a lower effort, photoshopped one.
